# ===================================================================
# Python Virtual Environment
# Rationale: The 'myURL' directory is a Python virtual environment. 
# Its contents can be reproduced by anyone using the 'requirements.txt' file.
# Committing it would unnecessarily bloat the repository and cause issues
# on different operating systems.
# ===================================================================
myURL/

# ===================================================================
# Data and Database Files
# Rationale: Database files (.db) change frequently with application use and can
# grow very large. Their temporary files (-shm, -wal) should never be tracked.
# It is best practice to track database schema through migration scripts
# rather than the data files themselves.
# ===================================================================
data/*.db
data/*.db-shm
data/*.db-wal

# ===================================================================
# Sensitive & Configuration Files
# Rationale: The .sesskey file appears to be a session key, which is sensitive
# information and should never be committed to version control. The .env file
# is a standard convention for storing environment-specific variables like
# API keys or database credentials.
# ===================================================================
.sesskey
.env

# ===================================================================
# Python Cache & Compiled Files
# Rationale: Python generates these files automatically for performance. They
# are not part of the source code and will be regenerated as needed.
# ===================================================================
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd

# ===================================================================
# Build Artifacts & Packaging
# Rationale: These directories are created when you build or package
# your project. They are not source files.
# ===================================================================
build/
dist/
*.egg-info/

# ===================================================================
# Log Files
# Rationale: Log files are generated during application execution and are not
# part of the source code.
# ===================================================================
*.log

# ===================================================================
# OS-specific and Editor Files
# Rationale: Files generated by operating systems (like macOS's .DS_Store) or
# code editors (.vscode, .idea) are specific to a user's local setup and
# should not be in the repository.
# ===================================================================
.DS_Store
